# Pathfinder-Character-Sheet
Character sheet to automate some of the skill and level up mechanics. A project to teach myself React.js. Currently on hold while I skill up in other areas.
Skill values increase based on the base stats they are dependent on. Data loaded with made up values to make it more interesting. 
Future update to read from local JSON for personal use. Won't have cloud save that way, but how many devices do I need this to be on?
Consider a database that will hand data as JSON when project grows.
